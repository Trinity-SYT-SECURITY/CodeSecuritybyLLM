# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! I appreciate your interest in helping us improve and grow. Please read this document carefully before submitting any pull requests, as it outlines the best practices for committing changes to our repository.

1. Use descriptive commit messages

When committing changes, please use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the purpose of the change. This helps us and other contributors understand the context of the change and why it was made.

Here's an example of a good commit message:

```
Added feature to calculate the area of a circle (#123)
```

In this example, the commit message clearly states what was added (a feature to calculate the area of a circle) and which issue number it resolves (issue #123).

2. Use consistent indentation

We use consistent indentation throughout our codebase to make it easier to read and understand. Please ensure that your changes maintain the same level of indentation as the surrounding code.

3. Follow PEP 8 naming conventions

We follow the PEP 8 naming conventions for Python, which means using lowercase words separated by underscores, with no leading underscores. Please ensure that your changes use these conventions when defining variables, functions, and classes.

4. Use meaningful commit titles

When creating a pull request, please give the commit a meaningful title that accurately describes the changes made. This helps us quickly understand the purpose of the change and decide whether to approve or reject the pull request.

Here's an example of a good commit title:

```
Fixed bug in calculation of circle area (#123)
```

In this example, the commit title clearly states what was fixed (a bug in calculating circle area) and which issue number it resolves (issue #123).

5. Use pull requests for all changes

We use pull requests for all changes to our repository, even if you're just fixing a small issue or adding a new feature. This helps us keep track of all changes and ensure that everything is properly tested and reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

6. Test your changes thoroughly

Before submitting a pull request, please test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. This includes running unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests to verify that your changes do not break existing functionality.

7. Follow the issue tracking process

When reporting an issue or suggesting a new feature, please follow the issue tracking process outlined in our repository. This helps us keep track of all issues and ensure that they are properly addressed.

Thank you for following these best practices when committing changes to our repository! By doing so, you help us maintain a high-quality codebase and make it easier for other contributors to understand and work with the code.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out!
